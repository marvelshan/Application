    <h1>Welcome to my GitHub Page!</h1>

    <h2>Personal Introduction:</h2>
    <p>
        I am a Software Engineer currently working as an SRE Engineer at my company. I am passionate about learning new technologies and continuously improving my technical skills. In the past, I have explored Hung-yi Lee's online courses, though I did not delve deeply into them. Additionally, I have experimented with open-source projects like gocv, but only at a basic level.
    </p>

    <h2>Statement of Purpose:</h2>
    <p>
        I am applying for this course because I see it as a valuable opportunity to build on my previous explorations and fully immerse myself in the subject matter. I hope to meet like-minded individuals who are also eager to learn, and I believe that by learning and sharing with others, we can grow together and expand this community of passionate learners. Through this course, I aim to strengthen my knowledge and contribute meaningfully to the learning environment.

    <h2>With the rapid evolution of software technology, how do you ensure that the field you choose to invest in is the right one and will yield returns?</h2>
    <p>
        I look for relevant communities and actively participate in them. I connect with people in the field and utilize online resources to learn. By applying what I’ve learned, I engage with experts, presenting my results to seek their guidance and ensure I am heading in the right direction.

    <h2>Please describe an experience that caused a strong negative emotion and how you dealt with that emotion.</h2>
    <p>
        I am passionate about outdoor activities, and when I face setbacks, I find solace in freediving. Being alone in the vastness of the ocean is incredibly calming—it allows me to quiet my mind and reflect. In the water, I feel small, much like in everyday life, but it also gives me perspective. When I return to land, I feel renewed, as if I’ve been reborn.
    </p>

    <h2>Share a technical insight you gained during the development of this application webpage.</h2>
    <p>
        One recent insight I gained comes from my strong interest in SRE and DevOps. I started by pursuing the SAA certification, and now I am actively involved in my company's DevOps and SRE tasks. Beyond just working with Kubernetes, I’ve developed a deep appreciation for Terraform and its Infrastructure as Code (IaC) capabilities. The experience of building a complete infrastructure from scratch using IaC is incredibly rewarding. I find the process of organizing and systematically setting up infrastructure both fascinating and enjoyable.
    </p>

    <h2>How do you view the connection between your work and the broader social community?</h2>
    <p>
        I am passionate about engaging with the community and have participated in many events such as Gopher Day, Security Commit, DevOps Days, and COSCUP. Although I don’t yet have the experience to present on stage, I actively share my knowledge through internal company presentations and reunions with my former study group partners. I look forward to future opportunities where I can share the knowledge I’ve gained with others in the community.
    </p>

    <h2>Time Arrangement</h2>
    <p>
        Every day, I set aside 2-3 hours for self-directed learning after work, and I take Fridays off to participate in community activities. Unless there are excessive business demands at my company that require my attention. I will dedicate more than 10 hours of study time on weekends.
    </p>

    <h2>Is there anything else you would like to say to us?</h2>
    <p>
        I am very grateful for the opportunity to participate in this event, which allows more people to engage with and learn about this field. I am excited to evolve alongside the advancements in technology and to progress together with these innovations!
